1. The main screen presents a button that says "Click Me".
2. When the button is clicked, a modal dialog opens.
3. The modal dialog contains a single field labelled "Enter a City".
4. That field uses the jquery-ui autocomplete plugin to look up cities, just as in the demo located here: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp. 
5. The application does not need a backend.
6. The applicaiton does not need to save any data.

#### How I would run the application:
1. Clone the repo
1. Run `server` from bash. I am using an adapted alias starting from this gist: https://gist.github.com/JeffreyWay/1525217
